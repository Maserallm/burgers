## Contribution

I am the sole contributor to this application. Thank you to Astoe Design for creating the svg burger images that was used from the Noun Project.

This front-end app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose! Choose each letter wisely as you only have seven chances to guess the right letter.
